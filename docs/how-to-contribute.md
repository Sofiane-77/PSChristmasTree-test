# How to contribute to the docs

PSChristmasTree uses ReadTheDocs to host our documentation.  This allows us to keep our docs in the repository, without the various limitations that come with the built in GitHub repo wiki.

* Commit changes
  * Organization is described in the [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/Sofiane-77/PSChristmasTree/blob/main/mkdocs.yml) file
  * mkdocs.yml points to markdown files in [the docs folder](https://github.com/Sofiane-77/PSChristmasTree/tree/main/docs)
  * Images are stored and accessible from [docs/img](https://github.com/Sofiane-77/PSChristmasTree/tree/main/docs/img)
